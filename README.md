Fruit Disease Identification Using Parallelized ANN 

This project presents a comprehensive method for developing a fruit disease recognition model using parallelized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically focusing on detecting diseases in papaya. Leveraging the exceptional performance of ANNs in image classification, the model aims to accurately identify various fruit diseases and differentiate between diseased and healthy fruits.

The methodology includes collecting high-quality images to create a diverse database, followed by preprocessing and augmentation to enhance model robustness. The architecture and training process of the ANN are thoroughly detailed, including parameter tuning and evaluation metrics to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, the project explores feature extraction and classification algorithms for precise and reliable disease diagnoses.

By integrating advanced image analysis with machine learning, this model enhances disease detection accuracy, facilitating early intervention and better management of fruit health in agricultural practices. Ultimately, the project aims to improve crop yields and reduce losses due to fruit diseases, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.
